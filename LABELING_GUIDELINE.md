- Do not annotate objects that are:
  - Obstructed beyond recognition
  - Severely blurred
  - Outside the scope of labeling targets

---

## File Saving  

- Annotations are automatically saved in the `/annotations/` folder as JSON files  
- Each JSON contains:
  - Image filename
  - List of annotated boxes with coordinates and labels

**Example:**

```json
{
  "filename": "uploaded_123456789.png",
  "boxes": [
    {
      "xmin": 50,
      "ymin": 60,
      "xmax": 200,
      "ymax": 250,
      "label": "Car"
    }
  ]
}
